                  The purpose of the Services is to try to help you save money with minimal effort. We debit your debit card (the amount you specify). You can request for your savings at anytime on any of our pay out days. Only funds from your debit card may be transferred to your SmartCoop Account. The funds in your SmartCoop Account are held at a bank for your benefit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your funds will remain in your SmartCoop Account until you instruct us to transfer any or all of your funds from your SmartCoop Account to your Bank Account by emailing us at <a href="mailto:hello@Smartcoophq.org">hello@Smartcoophq.org</a>. We will generally transfer the requested funds from your SmartCoop Account to your Bank Account within two Business Days of when we receive your request. It is important to know the amount of available funds in your SmartCoop Account before instructing us to transfer funds from your SmartCoop Account to your Bank Account. If you do not have sufficient available funds in your SmartCoop Account to cover the amount of the requested transfer, your request for the transfer will be declined. We may also transfer funds from your SmartCoop Account to your Bank Account without notice to you upon the closure of your SmartCoop Account as described below and at any time if required by applicable law or if we, in our sole discretion, suspect the Services are being used for illicit purposes or otherwise in violation of these Terms.

You are solely responsible for determining whether the funds debited from your debit card and the funds maintained in your SmartCoop Account are acceptable to you. We are not responsible for any third-party fees that may be incurred as a result of using the Services, including, but not limited to, third-party fees incurred as a result of maintaining insufficient funds in your Bank Account.

                  You may stop using the Services, close your SmartCoop Account, and cancel these Terms at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:hello@Smartcoophq.org">hello@Smartcoophq.org</a> or <a href="tel:08098075887">08098075887</a> and providing sufficient information for us to verify your identity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there are any pending transactions relating to your SmartCoop Account when we receive your termination notice, we will close your SmartCoop Account promptly after such transactions are completed. Your termination of these Terms will not affect any of our rights or your obligations arising under these Terms prior to termination.
                  Upon the closure of your SmartCoop Account, we will transfer the funds in your SmartCoop Account, if any, to your Bank Account on or after the next FREE withdrawal date. If your Bank Account is closed or we are otherwise unable to transfer the funds in your SmartCoop Account to your Bank Account, we will send you a cheque for the amount of the funds to you at your street address in our records on or after the next FREE withdrawal date.

The specified period of time to report and deliver funds to a state varies by state, but usually ranges between two and five years.

                  <u>Governing Law.</u> These Terms are made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

                  <u>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; JURY TRIAL WAIVER; </u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER. For any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims, or causes of action between you and us (including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action) relating to the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us), you and we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration. The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence. As used in this Section, "we" and "us" mean SmartCoop and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and all of its and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and representatives. In addition, "we" and "us" include any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the Nigeria Arbitration and Conciliation Act with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the Nigeria Arbitration and Conciliation Act’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "Rules and Procedures").
                </p>
                <p>
                  You should review this provision carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you are GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court in the state or municipality of your residence within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in that court. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and each party hereby agrees to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the federal judicial district of your residence for such purpose. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrators’ decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (B) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (d) we also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration; (e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (g) subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and (h) each party will pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This Section will survive termination of your SmartCoop Account and these Terms as well as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us. With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) of this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) of this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision, you must notify us of your election in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision or within 30 days of the effective date of any material change to these Terms by sending a written notice to us by certified mail at the following address: Smart Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society, Physical Office Address: No. 291, Warri/Sapele road Warri, Delta State. Nigeria. Attn: Arbitration Opt-Out. Your opt-out notice must include your name, address, phone number, and email address.

                  <u>Miscellaneous. </u>You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that we may, in our sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for ourselves. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms, together with our
                  <inertia-link :href="$route('app.privacy')">Privacy Policy</inertia-link>, constitute the entire and sole agreement between you and us with respect to the Services and supersedes all prior understandings, arrangements, or agreements, whether written or oral, regarding the Services.
